## Introduction
This repository serves as a digital archive of my journey into deep learning. My primary is focusing on practical implementations using TensorFlow and Keras. Through this self-study, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of deep learning concepts and techniques.

## Models (Sorted by Year)
In this section, I present an overview of the deep learning models that I have explored and personally implemented. Each model is accompanied by an URL link to its respective paper for reference.
